# password-generator

Generates a password, based on a series of prompts

## Description

This repository is home to a password generator.

Based on a series of user prompts, it generates a secure password, on the screen when the button is clicked.

It was created by using javascript functions. Lot of for and while loops are used to validated user information.

I have also, built it in such a way that, it is easy for developers to change the requirements, if needed. Simply enter the minimum/maxium length requirements, once at the top of the js file. Arrays can be taken away/ or added too, and the code, will still work. To add an array, add it the object, and the prompts will continue for the new array.

## Usage

To get a password generated, click the button. Answer a series of prompts, and a new password will be displayed on the screen.
From there, simply a highlight it, right click and press copy. The password can be pasted to wherever desired.
